          A credit limit is more than a number on your statement. It controls how much you can borrow, how flexible the card feels in daily life, and how your utilisation ratio looks to credit-score models.

    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit Limit?</h2>
      <p>Your credit limit is the maximum balance the issuer is willing to let you carry on a card. Within that overall ceiling, you may also see smaller limits, such as cash-advance limits, daily purchase caps or ATM withdrawal limits.</p>
      <p>Issuers treat the limit as a risk boundary. It can increase as you build a positive payment history, or be reduced if your risk profile worsens or spending behaviour changes in ways that worry the lender.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Issuers Decide Your Limit</h2>
      <p>When you apply for a card, the issuer looks at income, existing debt, past payment behaviour and your credit reports. Internal risk models then suggest a starting limit that balances convenience for you against potential loss for the lender.</p>
      <p>Over time, that limit can be adjusted automatically or on request. Consistent on-time payments, low utilisation and stable income tend to support limit increases, while missed payments, rapid new borrowing or reduced income can trigger reviews and cuts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Utilisation Ratio and Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Credit utilisation is the percentage of your available credit that you are currently using. Many scoring models treat lower utilisation as a sign of more conservative borrowing behaviour.</p>
      <p>Because utilisation is calculated both per card and across all your revolving accounts, a single low-limit card maxed out can send negative signals even if your total balances are modest.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Managing and Requesting Limit Changes</h2>
      <p>You can often request a credit-limit increase through the issuer’s app or website. Some requests trigger a hard credit check; others rely on internal data. Issuers may ask about income, housing costs and employment to update their view of your finances.</p>
      <p>In some situations, lowering your limit voluntarily can be sensible — for example on a card you reserve for online subscriptions, or if you want to cap the potential impact of fraud. The trade-off is less flexibility for large one-off purchases.</p>
